OpenICC

    The OpenICC configuration data base allows to story, share and manipulate
    colour management informations.

    Part of that is a file format based on JSON and a implementation of a 
    according library for easier access.


Features:
    Currently are serialised and parsed device informations.


Internet:
    git:  git://openicc.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/openicc/openicc (read-only)


Dependencies:
    Yajl - a JSON parser library http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/


Building:
    $ make
    $ make install

    A optional make check is provided.


Install:
    Copy the resulting library into your local library path if not to use
    the sources inside your code.


Usage:
    The library provides an easy to use API for DB access. Include the 
    openicc_config.h header file into your sources and link to the object file
    generated from openicc_config.c.
  Example:
    See the openicc_config_example.c file.


Known Bugs:
    The source code provides currently no mechanism for a write lock.
